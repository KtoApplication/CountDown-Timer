Background:
I am beginner to programming, so in order to improve my skills i decided to do a project. Some of the codes were taken from 
various locations (which I have included below). I am not making any claim that they are 100% my code. If you find any 
problem, please let me know. 

Input:
-The default time source code for python was taken from YouTube Bwhit, 
here is the video --->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n5vW3DhElw

-I wasn't sure how to read Wav files in python. Luckily i stumpled upon a post on stackoverflow. User zhangyangyu posted the
source code on how to go about reading the Wav file ---> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17657103/how-to-play-wav-file-in-python


Reason for Creation:
I created the countdown timer so I can use it to study. I would set a X minute interval and set the clock. Also I needed a 
clock which would keep track of the usage.

Features:
-Set X hours and Y mins
-Tracks Usage of timer
-Plays Song

Flaws:
-The timer is not so much of a countdown timer, instead it's a countup timer
-This is the first version of the timer, so it still inefficient.


Future Features:
-Actually make the timer countdown
-I would like to add GUI to the project
-Allow the user to choose their music
